        <h1>Interniting Is Easy</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in ay particular order</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
                <li>Buut, the list item elements are the same.</li>
                <li>Also note how the numbers imcrement on thier own</li>
                <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Sometimes</em>, yoou need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

                    <p>Other times, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.

                        <p>
                            <em>
                                <strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</em>
                                </strong>
</p>
                    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
                    <p>Thaks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
